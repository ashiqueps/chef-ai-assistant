chef ai troubleshoot "ERROR: Connection refused connecting to localhost:8889"

# Troubleshoot a log file
chef ai troubleshoot /var/log/chef/client.log
```

### Advanced Troubleshooting

```bash
# Provide both logs and configuration
chef ai troubleshoot --logs /var/log/chef/client.log --config /etc/chef/client.rb

# Troubleshoot with specific error message and logs
chef ai troubleshoot "Error executing action" --logs /var/log/chef/client.log
```

## Response Format

Troubleshooting results are formatted as follows:

```
üîç Analyzing issue:
  "ERROR: Connection refused connecting to localhost:8889"
[...] Consulting AI assistant...

üîß Troubleshooting Diagnosis:

This error occurs when Chef client is unable to connect to a service on port 8889 on localhost.

----------------------------------------
Solution:

Step 1: Verify if the service is running
Run the following command to check if anything is listening on port 8889:
  sudo lsof -i :8889

Step 2: Check firewall settings
Ensure that local connections on port 8889 are allowed:
  sudo iptables -L | grep 8889

Step 3: Examine Chef configuration
Make sure your Chef configuration is pointing to the correct endpoint and port.
Check your client.rb or knife.rb for any incorrect settings.

Step 4: Restart the service
If the service should be running on this port, try restarting it:
  sudo systemctl restart chef-service-name

Warning: Connection refused errors often indicate that a required service is not running or is misconfigured. Check the service's logs for additional clues.
