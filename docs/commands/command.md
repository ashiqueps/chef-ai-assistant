# Command Generator

The `command` command translates natural language descriptions into proper Chef CLI commands, helping you find and use the right syntax without memorizing complex command structures.

## Usage

```bash
# Standalone command
chef-ai command "Description of what you want to do" [options]

# Integration with Chef tools
chef ai command "Description of what you want to do" [options]
```

## Description

This command uses AI to convert plain English descriptions into proper Chef commands with the correct syntax and options. It helps you:

1. Find the right command for a task
2. Use proper syntax and arguments
3. Understand what each part of the command does
4. Fill in placeholders with your specific values
5. Get command explanations and usage notes

## Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--temperature TEMP` | Set the response creativity (0.0-2.0, default: 0.7) |
| `--verbose, -v` | Show detailed response information |
| `--help, -h` | Show help message |

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Generate a command to list nodes
chef-ai command "list all nodes"
# or: chef ai command "list all nodes"

# or: chef ai command "upload my apache cookbook"

# Bootstrap a node

```

### Complex Commands

```bash
# Generate a command with multiple options

## Interactive Process

The `command` command follows an interactive process:

1. **Analysis**: The AI examines your description to determine the appropriate Chef command
2. **Options**: Multiple command options may be presented if applicable
3. **Selection**: You choose which command variant best fits your needs
4. **Placeholders**: You're prompted to fill in placeholders like `<NODE_NAME>` with actual values
5. **Final Command**: The complete, ready-to-use command is presented

## Response Format

The interaction typically follows this pattern:

```
üîç Processing:
  "bootstrap a windows node"
[...] Generating command...

ü§ñ Chef Command Generator:
