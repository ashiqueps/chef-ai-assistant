ü§ñ AI Response:
In Chef, a cookbook is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution. Here's what you need to know:

A cookbook:
- Contains recipes, attributes, resources, templates, and other components
- Defines everything needed to configure a part of your infrastructure
- Can be shared and reused across different environments

The basic structure of a cookbook includes:
- metadata.rb: Defines cookbook properties like name, version, and dependencies
- recipes/default.rb: Contains the primary configuration code
- attributes/: Defines customizable values used in recipes
- templates/: Contains ERB template files
- resources/: Holds custom resources
- libraries/: Contains Ruby helper code

Cookbooks follow a specific directory structure and naming conventions to ensure they work properly with the Chef ecosystem.
