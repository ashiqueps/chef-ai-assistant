## Usage

### Configuration

Configure the Azure OpenAI client with your credentials:

```ruby
require 'chef-ai-assistant'

# Set up configuration with environment variables
# AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY, AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT, AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME

# Environment variables can be loaded from a .env file
# Create a .env file with:
# AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
# AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com
# AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=your_deployment_name

# Or configure manually
ChefAiAssistant.configure do |config|
  config.api_key = 'your-azure-openai-api-key'
  config.api_version = '2023-05-15' # Optional, defaults to this version
  config.azure_endpoint = 'https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com'
  config.deployment_name = 'your-model-deployment-name'
end
```

### Using the Azure OpenAI Client

```ruby
# Create a client using the configured settings
client = ChefAiAssistant.openai_client

# Send a chat request
response = client.chat("Hello, how can you help me with my Chef recipes?")
puts response.dig("choices", 0, "message", "content")

# Advanced usage with options
response = client.chat(
  "What's a good recipe for pasta?",
  {
    messages: [
      { role: "system", content: "You are a chef assistant that helps with recipes." },
      { role: "user", content: "What's a good recipe for pasta?" }
    ],
    temperature: 0.5,
    max_tokens: 1000
  }
)
```

### Command Line Interface

#### Using the Standalone `chef` Command

Chef AI Assistant comes with a standalone `chef` command that provides easy access to all AI assistant features:

```bash
# Basic usage
chef ai ask "How do I write a recipe for Apache installation?"
chef ai explain path/to/cookbook
chef ai command "list all nodes in production environment"

# Show help
chef --help
chef ai --help
```

For detailed usage of each subcommand, see the "Available Commands" section below.

#### Integrating with Other Chef Gems

Chef AI Assistant can also be integrated with other Chef gems (like chef-cli, knife, test-kitchen) to provide AI assistant capabilities via command line.

To add the `ai` command to your Chef gem:

```ruby
require 'chef-ai-assistant'

# Register the AI commands with your main CLI class
ChefAiAssistant.register_commands_with(YourGem::CLI)

# Configure the AI assistant
ChefAiAssistant.configure do |config|
  # Configuration as shown in the Configuration section
end
```

Once integrated, users can access the AI assistant through your gem's CLI:

### Using the Explain Feature

```
$ chef ai explain cookbooks/apache

üíº Analyzing:
  cookbooks/apache
[...] Consulting AI assistant...

ü§ñ AI Explanation:
This directory contains a Chef cookbook named "apache" that's responsible for installing and configuring the Apache web server...
```

### Using the Troubleshoot Feature

```
$ chef ai troubleshoot "ERROR: Connection refused connecting to localhost:8889"

üîç Analyzing issue:
  "ERROR: Connection refused connecting to localhost:8889"
[...] Consulting AI assistant...

üîß Troubleshooting Diagnosis:

This error occurs when Chef client is unable to connect to a service on port 8889 on localhost.

----------------------------------------
Solution:

Step 1: Verify if the service is running
Run the following command to check if anything is listening on port 8889:
  sudo lsof -i :8889

Step 2: Check firewall settings
Ensure that local connections on port 8889 are allowed:
  sudo iptables -L | grep 8889

Step 3: Examine Chef configuration
Make sure your Chef configuration is pointing to the correct endpoint and port.
Check your client.rb or knife.rb for any incorrect settings.

Step 4: Restart the service
If the service should be running on this port, try restarting it:
  sudo systemctl restart chef-service-name

Warning: Connection refused errors often indicate that a required service is not running or is misconfigured. Check the service's logs for additional clues.
```
